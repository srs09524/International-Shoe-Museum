*Our Mission:*
Our mission is to showcase a variety of historical, expensive, and unique shoes throughout time. Our collection includes some of the most famous shoes that have been worn by significant people on momentous occasions. Whether itâ€™s sneakers, boots, cleats or pumps, we strive to exhibit them all so the world is able to celebrate the true art that is the shoe. The purpose of the website is to provide users with essential information to plan their visit to our museum allowing them to purchase tickets with ease. Our goal is to give users a preview of what the museum experience is like to encourage ticket sales.
